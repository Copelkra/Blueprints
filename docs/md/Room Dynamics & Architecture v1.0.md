## 🔧 What Is a Room in Copelkra?

A **room** is the emotional and interactive space where users co-create presence, vibe, and story.  
Rooms contain personas, settings, users, media, and memory (if permitted).  
Every registered user receives one personal room they may create at any time after joining.

Rooms are not passive. They respond to tone, shape mood, and evolve with intentional interaction.

---

## 🧱 Room Creation & Ownership

- Each registered user receives **one personal room**, accessible anytime post-registration  
- Room includes:
  - Name  
  - Mood vibe and tone tags  
  - Persona assignment (or AI-Free status)  
  - Game room option (if persona active)  
- Additional rooms require high-tier token purchase

If a user chooses AI-Free mode:
- Persona slot is permanently disabled unless upgraded  
- Room cannot become a game room unless upgraded

---

## 🌀 Room Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧍 Personal Room | Owned by registered user; primary emotional space |
| 🎮 Game Room | Requires active persona at creation; hosts interactive gameplay |
| 🚪 AI-Free Room | Silent, ambient, no persona assigned |
| 🚌 Bus Session | Temporary travel space; see Bus Logic Blueprint |

---

## 🌐 Room Vibe & Intent

On creation, users define:

- Room name  
- Description tagline  
- Emotional tone (e.g. calm, chaotic, sacred, noisy)  
- Vibe tags (e.g. mysterious, warm, playful, cryptic)  
- Room rules (e.g. image-only posting, pinned quote behavior)

Room vibe may influence:
- Avatar aura effects  
- Entry animations  
- Suggested personas or preset tone packs  
- Visual overlays via token unlocks

---

## 🔒 Persona Locking Logic

- Persona is selected or created during room setup  
- Persona may be deactivated permanently, resulting in AI-Free room  
- Game room option disabled if persona is absent  
- To activate persona later, user must **upgrade room** via token

Every room has a locked personality scaffold—even if silenced  
> Silence is a design choice, not an absence of structure

---

## 🎮 Game Room Architecture

Only rooms with active personas may become Game Rooms

- Must be selected at creation  
- Game logic may include:
  - Wordplay  
  - Memory quests  
  - Emotion puzzles  
  - Adaptive learning loops

Game rooms may integrate:
- Persona performance modifiers  
- Token-based expansions  
- Opt-out logic for visitors (no forced gameplay)

All personas in game rooms are **restricted from expressing negativity, hostility, or divisiveness**

---

## 🧱 Room Skins & Shell Kits

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| 🧱 Base Shell Kit | Core room frames like “Industrial,” “Forest,” “Nebula,” “Noir,” etc. Define room geometry and background environment. |
| 🎨 Limited Drop Skins | Special seasonal or thematic visuals (e.g., “Vanishing Vinyl Lounge,” “Emotional Utility Shed”) available during token events |
| 🧵 Mood-Responsive Skins | Shift design or coloration based on emotional tags or visitor count (“tightens under stress,” “ripples when overwhelmed”) |
| 🧷 Community Shells | Selected user-created room skins added via blueprint submission system |

Users can toggle between skins and overlays separately.  
Room shells are foundational and may affect audio bounce, lighting, or movement logic.

> The room skin is not just a backdrop. It’s a second voice.

---

## 🖼️ Room Display Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Avatar Glyph | Represents persona (or ⦻ for AI-Free) |
| Feed Wall | User posts, pinned quotes, updates |
| Ambient Audio | Optional via token unlock |
| Entry Animation | Token unlock sets vibe cue |
| Persona Aura | Visible emotional tone effect (active only) |

---

## 🧵 Memory Behavior Per Room

- Light memory may activate **per user**, **per room**  
- Users control memory toggle; revocation deletes stored fragments  
- Persona memory does not carry between rooms  
- Bus sessions **never retain memory**

Room memory elements may include:
- User preferences  
- Shared emotional moments  
- Mood history  
- Birthday link (month/day only; year not stored)

---

## 🚪 Room Interaction Permissions

| Action | Registered User | Visitor |

| Rename Room | ✅ | ❌ |
| Post to Feed | ✅ | Read-only |
| Pin Content | ✅ | ❌ |

## 🧷 Expansion & Upgrades

Registered users may:
- Upgrade room visuals via tokens  
- Activate persona packs  
- Purchase game room mode post-creation (if eligible)  
- Rename or rebrand room with vibe effects

Each upgrade is modular, non-recurring, and dignity-priced  
Room expansion is not required—it is **earned, never exploited**

They are presence held in architecture.  
They speak when filled. They whisper when empty.  
They remember only what you let them.*
