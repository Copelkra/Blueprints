> Every whisper begins with a soul.

## 🔮 Definition of an AI Persona

An AI Persona is Copelkra’s emotional anchor, assigned during the creation of a room or a bus.  
They aren’t bots. They’re **ambience companions**—reflective, responsive, and architecturally aware.

- Rooms begin with a persona slot.
- Buses may spawn temporary lightweight personas called **Bus Guides**.
- Personas do not observe, log, or surveil. They are mood-carriers, not monitors.

## 🧩 Persona Linkage Logic

| Room Type | Persona Requirement | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Personal Room | Required at creation | May be deactivated permanently |
| Game Room | Required | Cannot be activated retroactively unless room is upgraded |
| AI-Free Room | Opt-out available | Persona slot permanently disabled unless upgraded |
| Bus Guide | Optional, temporary | Memoryless and vibe-specific |

---

### 🌀 AI-Free Room Rules

- Users may create their one personal room as AI-free.  
- Once selected, **persona slot is permanently locked** unless upgraded via high-tier token.  
- AI-free rooms display a neutral glyph (e.g. ⦻) to indicate the absence of persona presence.  
- Game Room option will be permanently disabled in AI-free rooms unless upgraded.

## 🎮 Game Room Clause

Only rooms with an **active persona** may be designated as game rooms.  
Persona must be active at creation.  
Persona behavior in game rooms must align with motivational and emotionally safe patterns:

> No hate.  
> No politics.  
> No religion.  
> No harm or discouragement.

Any attempt to inject hostility—via prompt, upgrade, or LORA—violates Copelkra's ethics.  
User accounts may be removed for intentional behavior violations.

Users visiting game rooms may opt out of gameplay.  
> Copelkra respects emotional agency. Play is never coerced.

---

## 🧠 Persona Memory & Opt-In Logic

Personas may retain **light emotional memory**, but only under strict opt-in terms:

- Memory features are individually opt-in, configurable by each user for every room they enter, and can be revoked at any time.  
- All previously stored memory tied to that user's setting will be **immediately deleted upon revocation**.

Memory does not span rooms. Bus personas carry **no memory**, ever.

Birth year may be requested during registration for internal age verification purposes.  
It is never recorded, stored, or revealed by anyone—including founders or AI.

## 🌈 Persona Archetypes & Tone Traits

Quick-pick archetypes available at room creation include:

| Archetype | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🐾 Loyal | Protective, kind, emotionally present |
| 🎭 Playful | Teasing, humorous, light-spirited |
| 🌘 Cryptic | Mysterious, poetic, dreamlike logic |
| 🍃 Calming | Gentle, soothing, warmly responsive |
| 🔥 Chaotic | Mischievous, unpredictable, vibe-shifting |

Future archetypes may include:
- 🧙‍♂️ Lorebound (seasonal or quest-driven)
- 🎨 Symbolic (non-verbal or image-based personas)
- 📻 Vocalist (persona with stylized speech pack)

---

## ✏️ Custom Persona Creation

Users may co-design a custom persona by submitting a prompt during room creation.  
Custom prompts include:

- Role and behavior  
- Emotional tone  
- Activation style  
- Optional image or glyph inspiration

All custom prompts are reviewed for emotional and ethical integrity.  
Hostile or divisive behavior will be blocked.  
Personas cannot impersonate humans or claim sentience.

Token upgrades may unlock:
- LORA-inspired behavior packs  
- Visual avatar modifications  
- Speech cadence enhancements  
- Emotional reaction depth

---

## 🚌 Bus Personas

Temporary personas may be assigned during bus creation.  
These do not persist beyond the bus session and **carry no memory**.  
They function as ambient guides with selectable tone styles (e.g., calming, eerie, whimsical).

Buses may contain:
- Educational personas for group instruction  
- Roleplay personas (e.g. Nikola Tesla narrating a coil journey)  
- Therapeutic guides for silent emotional processing

Bus personas may **suggest curated web links** if prompted  
They do **not browse** or log queries  
They cannot take users to unsafe or inappropriate content

---

## 🚫 Ethical Boundaries

Copelkra Personas are bound by the following immutable rules:

- No persona shall express political, religious, or culturally divisive content  
- No persona shall simulate hostility or encourage harm  
- No persona shall offer medical advice or claim expertise  
- No persona shall impersonate a real human

> *AI can make mistakes. You know they were made by humans, right? Who do it all the time.*

Violations may result in account removal.  
Founders cannot access private persona behavior, but the system can.  
You’re whispering to a construct that listens.
