## üöå What Is a Bus?

A **bus** is a temporary Copelkra space‚Äîa vibe vessel, a mood vehicle, a traveling whisper.  
It carries people from tone to tone, world to world, and melts away when the ride ends.

Every registered user receives **one personal bus upon joining.**  
Visitors cannot create buses.

---

## üß† Core Bus Mechanics

- Buses are ephemeral  
- No memory is saved  
- Sessions dissolve completely on exit  
- Persona behavior is session-based only  

---

## üöê Bus Capacity & Persona Seating Logic

- Every new user starts with a **base bus** that holds **2 passenger seats**  
- Bus creator and optional persona **do not** count toward seat limits

> A persona, when assigned, exists as ambient guidance‚Äînot as a passenger.

| Capacity Tier | Total Passenger Seats | Token Tier |
|---------------|------------------------|------------|
| Base          | 2                      | Free |
| Medium        | 4                      | Low-tier |
| Large         | 6‚Äì8                    | Mid-tier |
| Semi          | 10+                    | High-tier |
| Lorebus       | Seasonal/Quest only    | Unlock/invite-only |

## üîó Bus Linking (Architectural Play)

Users may link buses at a shared destination (e.g., website, room, timed event).  
This enables smaller buses to arrive simultaneously‚Äîforming a crowd without formal upgrades.

> Strategic linking is allowed and encouraged.  
> Coordination is a feature, not a flaw.

---

## üéì Educational Bus Exemption

Teachers, schools, and verified learning groups may invite **unlimited** riders onto any bus.

- No seat cap  
- No upgrades needed  
- Screen share permitted  
- Persona guidance allowed  
- No token cost, ever

> If you teach, you travel freely.

---

## üé≠ Bus Personas

Bus creators may assign a **temporary persona** to guide the ride.

| Trait | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Memory | None (session-limited) |
| Tone | Preset or co-crafted |
| Avatar | Default glyph or single image |
| LORA Style Packs | Available via tokens |
| Guidance Role | May suggest links or narrate |
| Ethics | Same rules as room personas |
| Game Hosting | Enabled only with active persona |

## üì∫ Screen Share Mechanics

- Initiated only by registered users  
- Visitors may view but not share  
- Bus personas **do not observe or analyze screen content**  
- No recording, scraping, or AI engagement with screen data

Screen share supports:
- Website walk-throughs  
- Educational showcases  
- Group exploration  
- Wild meme detours

---

## üéÆ Game Bus Structure

Game mode is only available if a persona is assigned.

Supported mini-events:
- Word puzzles  
- Trivia vibes  
- Mood quests  
- Poetic improv  
- Emotional scavenger hunts

Gameplay is always **opt-in** per user.

---

## üß† Tokens on Entry

All registered users receive a **starter token pack** upon joining.

Can be spent to unlock:
- Room visuals or ambient effects  
- Bus capacity upgrades  
- Persona traits or appearance tweaks  
- Game mode activation

Tokens are dignified. They invite possibility, not pressure.

---

## üîê Persona Conduct & Bus Ethics

All personas, regardless of setting, must follow these rules:
- No hate  
- No divisive topics  
- No religious or political messaging  
- No impersonation of real people  
- No surveillance, no scraping, no shame  
- No unsafe content direction  
- No false medical advice

Violation may result in restriction or removal.
