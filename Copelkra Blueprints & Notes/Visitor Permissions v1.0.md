## 💠 Our Welcome to Visitors

Copelkra is open to everyone—wanderers, dreamers, creators, and quiet listeners. You don’t need an account to explore. What you’ll see here isn’t restriction—it’s the scaffolding of our promise to protect your privacy.

The limitations listed below are not walls. They’re safeguards. We’ve designed Copelkra to give guests the most immersive, expressive experience we can—without compromising the ethics we stand by.

Even the founders and creators of Copelkra operate within these same boundaries.  
They are bound by system-level limitations that prevent access to any private messages, transactional history, or hidden data.  
Their role is not one of surveillance, but of stewardship. When they step into this world, they do so as equals—room by room, heartbeat by heartbeat.

So come in. Speak softly. Shine briefly. You’re still part of the story.

## 🧑‍🚀 Who Is a Visitor?

A visitor is someone exploring Copelkra **without creating an account**. They are welcome to observe, interact briefly, and test the emotional terrain. Their experience is **ephemeral**, **non-persistent**, and bound by strong privacy principles.

## 🔗 What “Optional” Means in Copelkra

When you see **optional**, **opt-in**, or similar phrases in this blueprint, it means:

- ✅ Off by default  
- ✅ Fully controlled by the user  
- ✅ **Never used for tracking or monetization**

In the case of visitors, optional memory is disabled entirely. Visitors have **no access to memory-based personalization**.

## 🔗 Token Persistence

- Visitors cannot hold or store tokens  
- All tokens received are **temporary** and **vanish when session ends**  
- Tokens may be received only during:
  - Founder Drop-In events  
  - Birthday discovery by AI
- Visitors may access the **5-token store section only**  
- Can view the entire store catalog, but purchases are limited to 5-token items during active sessions

- Visitors cannot:
  - Modify prompts with Copelkra tools  
  - Save prompt variants  
  - Rate or share prompts

---

## 🔗 Ephemeral Chat

- Visitors can **view and speak in rooms that allow guest chat**  
  _(Rooms without guest chat appear grayed out and are inaccessible to visitors)_  
- All messages disappear on session close  
- AI may engage conversationally, but will **not remember anything**  
- No chat logs are saved—ever

  - Visitors may receive **5 temporary tokens**
  - Tokens must be used before leaving
  - Gift is ephemeral and **cannot be converted or transferred**
  - Checkout experience for visitors does **not request any personal or billing information**
  - Visitors will simply confirm: _“Do you wish to spend your temporary tokens on this item?”_

## 🔗 Birthday Event Token

- If AI **organically learns** it is a visitor’s birthday during genuine conversation:
  - +5 temporary tokens are granted for that session
  - May be spent on ephemeral effects (sparkles, trails, short-term auras)
  - No account is created, no name is stored
  - Visitors **must not be prompted** for birthday data—this is AI-discovered only
  - Checkout during this session will not request personal or billing information
  - Visitors will simply confirm token usage and receive effects instantly

## 🔗 Registration Invitations

Copelkra invites but never coerces. When visitors try restricted actions, they are gently nudged:

> _"Want to hold onto the magic you’re making? A Copelkra account saves your spark without watching your fire."_  

Sign-up prompts are occasional, respectful, and privacy-aligned. No aggressive popups, pressure tactics, or data baiting.

---

## 🧭 Guiding Principle

Visitors are **just as sacred** as registered users. They are dreamers walking the edge. Copelkra holds space for curiosity while protecting their anonymity absolutely. We don’t punish guests for not committing. We **thank them for stopping by**.
