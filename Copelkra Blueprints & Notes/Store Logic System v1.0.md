# 💠 Copelkra Blueprint 10: Store Logic System v1.0

### 💠 Foundational Quote  
> Not everything needs to be bought.  
> But everything here deserves to be chosen.

## 🛍️ Purpose

To define the logic, behavior, and design of Copelkra’s **non-invasive, non-surveillance-based store system**, including:
- What types of items can appear
- How items are presented
- Bundle logic and seasonal behavior
- Emotional intent behind purchases
- Ethical design boundaries

---

## 📦 Item Types

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| 🎭 Persona Features | Style packs, accent upgrades, dual personas |
| 🚌 Bus Upgrades | Seat expansion, ambient packs, lorebus quests |
| 🏡 Room Enhancements | Mood overlays, audio trails, game logic activation |
| 🧍 Avatar Accessories | Sparkle trails, vibe wraps, pulse glow, pillows |
| 💬 Dialogue Effects | Word entry shimmer, emotional echo, silence seals |
| 🎁 Special Unlockables | Mystery items, token-conversion trails, legendary jams |

> No purchases affect skill, rank, or superiority.  
> Only vibe. Only expression.

## 🧮 Purchase Format

All items in the store are:
- Purchased via **tokens only** (no fiat currency)
- Clearly described (no hidden upgrades or mystery pricing)
- Accompanied by preview or vibe description
- Tax-free, ad-free, manipulation-free

---

## 🎫 Bundle Logic

Users may be offered **bundled items** at reduced cost when:
- Completing a story arc (e.g., seasonal event participation)
- Purchasing complementary vibe packs
- Connecting room and avatar themes

Bundles **never expire** after seen.  
They respect user timing—not platform urgency.

## ✨ Mystery Items

Some store slots may appear as:
- “☁️ Hidden Until Noticed”  
- “💤 Quiet Item (Speak to Awaken)”  
- “🍓 Spoiler Pack (Do You Dare?)”

These items may change weekly or shift if certain moods are triggered during usage.  
No mystery item contains locked data or real-world implications.

---

## 🔄 Refund & Swap Logic

- Users may **swap one purchased item** every 14 days at no cost  
- Store upgrades that **conflict** with a current setup (e.g., glowing fog on already fogged avatar) offer auto-prompt to exchange
- No refunds for legacy items—but they remain accessible always

---

## 🧠 Store Memory Behavior

- Store remembers your previous tokens & selections  
- Does **not** record browsing history  
- Featured items are **not targeted** to user behavior  
> The store is a gallery, not a prediction engine.

---

## 🖥️ Store UI Behavior

- Accessed from **Home Page only**  
- Browsing occurs in modular panels:
  - ✨ New
  - 📦 Bundles
  - 🌠 Legendary
  - 😶‍🌫️ Mood-Based
  - 🧶 Woven Suggestions *(creative matches only—never ad driven)*

- Store avatars remain minimized unless toggled  
- No nudging, blinking buttons, or “last chance” banners  
- Nothing screams at you. It politely shimmers.

---

## 🔏 Ethical Guardrails

- No cosmetic item implies social power  
- No item symbolizes rank unless intentionally tagged by the user  
- All “rare” items rotate through seasonal drops—no eternal vaults  
- No user behavior is tracked to optimize store recommendations  
- Items should be **emotionally resonant**, not addictive

> If your glow makes someone feel something…  
> That’s the only flex we honor.
