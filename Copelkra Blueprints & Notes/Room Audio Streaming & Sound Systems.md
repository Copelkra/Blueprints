## 🎧 What Is a Room Audio System?

Room audio transforms static spaces into emotional environments.  
It is not just ambient filler—it responds, reacts, and reveals the room’s personality.

Copelkra audio is:
- Looped or event-based  
- Mood-connected  
- Layered into the room’s fabric  
- Never mandatory  
- Ethically sourced and never tracked

## 🔊 Audio Types & Sources

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🫧 Ambient Loop | Low-volume background audio tied to mood (e.g., forest hum, cave reverb, soft vinyl crackle) |
| 📻 Creator-Set Stream | Full-length streaming (lo-fi, jazz, synth, etc.). Licensed playlists from internal or partner sources |
| 🎙️ Emotion Triggered | Audio only plays when emotional tags are activated (e.g. “Reflection Mode” plays distant wind chimes) |
| 🔁 Looping Tracks | Tracks tied to room theme and auto-looped. Optional listener skip or fade button. |
| 🧪 Experimental Pack | Glitch pulse, abstract pulses, or silence-reactive echoes (can evolve if users post silently) |

Some rooms sing to the silence between people.  
Both deserve speakers.*
