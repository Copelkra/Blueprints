## ✏️ Room Naming & Visibility

- Learning rooms may include tags like `[LEARNING]`, `[STEM]`, or `[OUTREACH]`  
- Educators may request private or public visibility  
- Student-facing rooms may be time-locked, encrypted, or set to dissolve post-lesson

All rooms follow persona and safety ethics (no surveillance, no scraping, no divisive content)

---

## 🔐 Safety Guidelines

- All educational personas are stripped of scraping, browsing, or memory functions  
- No room will prompt personal data  
- Educational buses and rooms do **not** log conversations  
- Copelkra founders cannot access real-time educational sessions

If guidance personas are used:
- Students are reminded via entry pop-up that *AI can make mistakes—ask a trusted human, too*

---

## 🔎 Discoverability (Optional)

- Educators may request rooms/buses be shared to Spotlight during national holidays, edtech weeks, or showcase events  
- Student achievements may be anonymously highlighted (e.g. vibe-designed rooms, quote walls) only with opt-in

---

## 🛐 Outreach Inclusion

Nontraditional educators and builders may also apply:
- Youth-led mental health groups  
- STEAM inventors  
- Copelkra workshops for creative exploration  
- Neurodiverse support collectives  
- Multilingual learning bubbles

> If your mission is to uplift, we’re ready to listen.
