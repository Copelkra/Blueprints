## 🖥️ What Is Screen Sharing in Copelkra?

**Screen sharing** allows room owners and registered users to **cast a browser tab, app window, or document** into their room for guests to view.

It is:
- Intentional (never automatic)
- Opt-in for all viewers
- Emotionally buffered (visual cues + moderation controls)
- Always accompanied by disclaimers

## 💻 Screen Share Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 📽️ Tab Sharing | Stream specific tab or external content into room layout |
| 🧭 Pointer Sync | Host pointer visible during interactions (optional) |
| 📂 Static Snapshot | Freeze-frame view for showing a moment, not a live stream |
| 💬 Text Overlay | Option to add live annotations or pinned notes next to content |
| 📝 Auto Disclaimer | Mini popup for viewers: “This is a shared visual. Don’t assume it's the room host’s personal content.” |

Screen sharing **never displays personal desktop or notifications**—only selected content by the host.

## 🧩 Access Logic

| User Type | Access |
|-----------|--------|
| 🧍 Visitor | ❌ No access |
| ✅ Registered User | ✅ Unlock via **Screen Share Activation Pack** |
| 🎓 Educators / Outreach | ✅ Always granted, no token cost |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Co-Hosts | ✅ If permissions granted by room host |

Once unlocked, screen sharing becomes a permanent tool on the user’s account.

## 🧠 Memory & Privacy Behavior

- Shared screen content is **never interpreted, logged, or stored**
- AI persona **cannot “see” the shared screen** unless user selects “AI Co-Browse Companion” (experimental)
- Viewer interactions (zoom, pause, scroll) are not tracked
- Public rooms will always notify all users when screen share is active

> Copelkra AIs don’t learn from what you show.  
> They listen to what you *say* about it.

## 🔐 Ethical Overlays & Controls

| Protection | Function |
|------------|----------|
| ⚠️ Content Disclaimer | Always shows: “Shared content may not be safe. Exit if unsure.” |
| 🚫 Block Trigger Words | Auto-filter scans overlays/tabs for visible hate speech or trauma-linked content (can pause the share) |
| 📵 Exit Hatch | Viewers can click a “no thanks” button to skip/gray-out the stream |
| 🧊 Freeze Mode | Host can disable interactions and lock visual until reset |

Educators have access to a “soft pointer” tool that **never shames or trails**—it simply glows when guidance is offered.

## 🧱 Room Integration Behavior

| Room Type | Share Behavior |
|-----------|----------------|
| 🧍 Personal Room | Full access if enabled |
| 🚌 Bus Session | Screen share permitted for ride-alongs (only host viewable) |
| 🛑 AI-Free Room | Screen share permitted, but no AI interaction allowed |
| 🎮 Game Room | Disabled during active puzzle/quest unless hosted content is puzzle-linked |

## 🎨 Visual Presentation Modes

- 🔳 **Framed View**: Screen floats as its own panel  
- 🖼️ **Picture Wall**: Cast becomes part of room background  
- 🎞️ **Slide Mode**: For presentations, shown 1 tab/image at a time  
- 🌙 **Dim Mode**: Room darkens during share to shift attention
