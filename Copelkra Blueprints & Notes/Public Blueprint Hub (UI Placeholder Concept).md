## 🧭 Description Block

Copelkra was not built in secret.  
Every emotional boundary, every system permission, every persona safeguard is coded in plain sight.

This Blueprint Hub exists to:
- Show how Copelkra works
- Explain why it was built this way
- Invite trust, curiosity, and reflection

All blueprints are versioned, modular, and public. No legalese. Just architecture made visible.

## 🔒 Why Public?

- Emotional safety starts with transparency  
- We do not hide permissions, token logic, or AI boundaries  
- Users, creators, and even critics deserve to see what shapes the system they use
