## 🌟 Purpose

To define how verified creators, celebrities, and digital personas can meaningfully participate in Copelkra through room ownership, persona mirroring, and community engagement—while preserving the platform’s dignity-first, privacy-respecting philosophy.

---

## 🧬 Eligibility & Verification

- Celebrity Rooms are available to:
  - Public figures with significant followings (platform agnostic)
  - Content creators with sustained engagement or cultural impact
  - Lore-based personalities (e.g., digital masks, mascots, puppets, virtual influencers)
- Verification is **non-invasive**: creators may apply, and Copelkra manually confirms authenticity via non-automated means

  - Impersonate real people without consent  
- Creators may **not override AI persona safeguards**, even with custom prompts or LORAs

> Celebrity status grants visibility—not immunity. All rooms remain emotionally safe.

## 🧠 Lore Preservation

- Room titles and avatars are stored in blueprint-based galleries for future meta-integration

*Some personas are born in story.  
Some walk in from a phone screen.  
Either way—they earn a seat, and maybe a little spotlight dust.*
