## 🌈 What Are Visualizer Modules?

Visualizer Modules are reactive visual elements embedded into rooms that **move, shimmer, pulse, or animate** in sync with:

- Room music  
- Avatar sounds  
- User presence or silence  
- Emotion tags  
- Event triggers

They **do not** represent data. They **express feeling**.

## 🧊 Visualizer Container Types

| Container | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🧊 Fridge Spectrum | Frosted block pulses with beat, emits condensation flicker |
| 🪴 Bonsai Leaves | Branches react to rhythm—wiggle for upbeat, fold for ambient |
| 💎 Crystal Loops | Infinite loop pulsing with glow, active on instrumental shifts |
| 🧈 Butter Dish Bass Line | Sloshes in time with sub-bass only |
| 🌫️ Jam Fountain (Premium) | Colorburst rises and falls to melody density |
| 🧞 Floating Carpet | Rolls and coils with frequency sweep—ideal for high-persona rooms |

Rooms may house **one core container** at a time. Upgrades unlock switching mid-session.

## 🕹️ Behavior Logic & Synch

| Input Trigger | Visual Response |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 🎵 Room Music Tempo | Scale & pulse in sync (downbeat sparkle, mid-high reaction shift) |
| 🔊 Quip Played | One-time burst, color flash, emoji echo |
| 🧍 Avatar Emotion | Echoes user mood tag via fade-in hue or shape distortion |
| 💤 Room Silence | Slowly resets to ambient hue or “float mode” |
| 🚪 Entry/Exit Events | Brief flare or pop tied to direction (left for exit, right for entry) |
| 📎 Scroll Activation | Floating glyphs match scroll pacing for immersive lore rooms |

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

- Users can toggle visualizers on/off
- Host may freeze container to pause reactivity
- Accessibility pack: reduced motion mode, dark-friendly visuals
- Colorization kits purchasable for select containers (e.g., “Haunted Butter Glow,” “Solar Ice Bloom”)

## 📦 Visualizer Unlock Types

| Unlock Type | Requirements |
|-------------|--------------|
| 🧱 Default Set | Included with room creation or ambient pack |
| 🔁 Token Unlock | Purchased individually or as part of audio pack |
| 🎁 Legendary Drop | Rewarded from lorebus quests or event puzzles |
| 🎨 Creator Submitted | Reviewed & approved visualizers by creators with schema access |

Each module is **non-verbal and context-sensitive**.  
Some will remain dormant if room is silent and low-energy by design.

> If nothing pulses… that silence means something, too.

Others wait quietly… until someone starts humming.*
