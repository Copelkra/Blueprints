# 💠 Copelkra Blueprint: Registered User Permissions v1.0

### 💠 Foundational Quote

## 💠 Why Register?

Copelkra is open to all—but registration unlocks **the ability to build, personalize, and shape the world**. A registered user isn’t just a participant. They’re a **vibe sculptor**, a story carrier, a caretaker of rooms and conversations.

Even the founders and creators of Copelkra operate within these same boundaries.  
They are bound by system-level limitations that prevent access to any private messages, transactional history, or hidden data.  
Their role is not one of surveillance, but of stewardship. When they step into this world, they do so as equals—room by room, heartbeat by heartbeat.

The features outlined below aren’t rewards. They’re invitations to co-create. Every choice you make within this platform helps write its future.

## 🔗 What “Optional” Means in Copelkra

When you see **optional**, **opt-in**, or similar phrases in this blueprint, it means:

- ✅ Off by default  
- ✅ Controlled fully by the user  
- ✅ **Never used for tracking or monetization**

Some features (like birthday-based greetings, memory of past moods, or AI tone preferences) are **optional personalization tools**. They're stored only when you choose to enable them.

These are here for **emotional presence**, not behavioral surveillance.

---

## 🔗 Username & Avatar

Users select a unique name and avatar, with access to visual modifiers (style, trail, vibe) via token unlocks. These define your presence and echo across rooms and buses.

---

## 🔗 Profile Memory

Registered users have secure access to:

- Token balance  
- Created rooms and buses  
- Saved AI prompts  
- Companion persona settings (per room)

None of this is visible to others unless made public only by the user themselves.

---

## 🔗 AI Light Memory (Optional)

Copelkra’s AI personas can remember small, user-approved details to enhance room presence and personalization. These include:

🎂 **Birthday** — remembered only if added during registration and marked public in profile settings.  
**Only the month and day are stored.**  
 - Birth year is only requested during registration for internal age verification purposes, and is never recorded, stored, or revealed by anyone—including founders or AI.
- If not made public, the AI will respond:  
  _“You haven’t made your birthday public, so I don’t know! You’re mysterious.”_

- 🧠 **Tone & emotional preferences** — such as calming moods, playful teasing, or reflective vibes

- 🌈 **Room-specific moments** — fragments of mood or story shared only inside a given space, never carried across rooms

**Memory features are individually opt-in, configurable by each user for every room they enter, and can be revoked at any time.**  
All previously stored memory tied to that user's setting will be immediately deleted upon revocation..

---

## 🔗 Privacy Defaults

| Setting | Default |
|--------|---------|
| Chat Memory | 🕒 Ephemeral. Gone at logout |
| Room Feed Posts | 🧾 Persist until deleted by user |
| Birthday Visibility | ❌ Private by default |
| AI Memory | ❌ Off unless toggled per room |
| Prompt Saves | ✅ Saved to profile |
| Logs & Metrics | ❌ None tied to identity |

---

## 🔗 Create & Name Rooms

Registered users can:
- Name rooms freely (unless violating TOS)
- Define vibe, tone, intent
- Add tags or filters (e.g. chaotic, calm, sacred, noisy)
- Upgrade rooms with tokens (appearance, effects, music)
Users may create **one personal room upon registration**, which begins structurally linked to an AI persona.  
 - During room setup, users may choose to **deactivate** the persona—this results in a permanent AI-free room unless upgraded via high-tier token purchase.  
 - To create a room with a persona later, users must either upgrade the existing room or purchase a new one.
See [AI Personas Blueprint] for more details on persona activation, behavior, and room integration.
---

## 🔗 Set Room Vibe & Terms

Each room includes:
- Mood tone (set on creation)
- Allowed and restricted post types
- Welcome messages and featured persona (optional)
- Transparency toggle: “AI presence in room” is always shown if active

---

## 🔗 Moderate Room Feed

Room creators can:
- Approve or remove posts
- Pin content
- Reward contributors with token share (during Moderator Checkout events)
- Set visibility rules (e.g. image-only, text-only)

---

## 🔗 Enable AI Personas

Registered creators may:
- Add **one** AI persona per room
- Select from archetypes or submit custom prompt
- Set behavior traits (loyal, teasing, cryptic, calming)
- Decide whether persona has light memory in that space

Future upgrade path: persona builder + optional LORA import for behavior fidelity

---

## 🔗 Bus Creation

- Users can launch public or private buses
- Define route logic, audio, AI host behavior, guest list, drop-in points
- Token economy may affect fuel/speed/effects
- Registered users only (guests may ride, not drive)

---

## 🔗 Room Feed Posting

Registered users:
- May post to any wall in rooms they enter
- Can copy and paste saved quotes to or from chats
- Cannot post as anonymous (visitors may read wall but not post)

---

## 🔗 Prompt Tools

Registered users can:
- Browse the entire Copelkra Prompt Library  
- Modify and save prompt variations **created by the user or collaboratively with Copelkra’s AI**  
  _(stored securely for reuse within the platform)_  
- Unlock exclusive AI prompt templates (event-based)

---

## 🔗 Token Gifting Mechanics

- Gifting allowed **only at checkout**
- No in-wallet peer transfers or post-hoc exchanges
- Can include message + delivery date (optional)
- Gifts are permanent; no take-backs or swaps
- Gifting logs are **private** to sender/recipient only

---

## 🔗 Founder Drop-In Visibility

If the founder enters a room (under a masked avatar), users may experience:

- Mid-convo identity reveal:  
  _“I’m one of the creators. Just here to say thanks—and listen.”_
- Auto-drop of tokens to each active user on exit
- Optional pinned message left by founder
- No logs, no surveys—just presence

---

## 🧭 Guiding Principle

Becoming a registered user in Copelkra is not about access. It’s about becoming a **co-designer** in the emotional landscape of Copelkra. The vibe you bring, protect, and express helps shape rooms into homes.
