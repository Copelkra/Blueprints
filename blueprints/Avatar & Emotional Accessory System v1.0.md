## 🧍 What Is an Avatar in Copelkra?

Avatars are not tied to data, gender, or identity.  
They are **emotional vessels**.  
Some sparkle. Some sit quietly. Some are socks.

They exist only where they’re needed, never getting in your way unless you *want* them to.

## 🎙️ Quip Sounds: Avatar-Linked Audio Clips

Users may assign a custom sound quip (2.5 seconds max) to **individual premium avatars**.

| Feature | Behavior |
|--------|-----------|
| 🎧 Playback | Activates when a user **clicks an avatar** (optional toggle) |
| ☁️ Quip Types | Pre-set vibe sounds, user-recorded audio, or uploaded mini stingers |
| 🔁 Reusability | Uploaded quips saved to **profile library**, assignable across avatars |
| 👁️ Reaction Emote | Each quip may trigger a floating emoji above the avatar (custom or pre-selected) |
| 🔏 TOS Enforcement | Audio containing harassment, slurs, or violations are auto-muted and stored for moderator action |
| ⚙️ Trigger Limits | Playback limited to once per minute per viewer to avoid spam |
| 🎭 Persona Masking | Avatar masks or cloaks will still play their sound quips if tapped directly |

> Not all quips are musical. Some whisper, some giggle, some say, *“Stop clicking me, you pervert.”*

---

## 🌈 Avatar-as-Visualizer Mode (Reactive Aura Sync)

Certain premium avatars (✨Rare-tier or higher✨) include **reactive visual modes** that pulse or shift based on:

| Trigger | Avatar Reaction |
|--------|------------------|
| 🎵 Room Audio Tempo | Aura pulse syncs to bass or beat logic |
| 🫧 Audio Quip Activation | Short burst glow or particle animation |
| 🔊 Game Room Background | Ambient color drift triggered by rhythm packets |
| ✨ Emotional Room State | High vibe = sparkle fog, Low vibe = shiver bloom |

| Visualizer Container Options |
|------------------------------|
| 🍳 Floating Gem Dish |
| 🧊 Frozen Fridge Halo |
| 🪴 Bonsai Frequency Leaves |
| 💦 Jam Ripple Field (Premium) |

Users may toggle **aura effects off** at any time for accessibility or battery saving.

> Sometimes, being the beat is better than dancing to it.

## 👁️ Floating Avatars in Shared Web Spaces

- Avatars only appear when the **Copelkra UI collapses**
- Used in shared browsing, buses, and public room transitions
- Avatars may be **click-dragged** (cursor devices only)
  - Join-order sets display layer; last-click brings to front
  - Dragging is optional and disabled during dense content views
- Avatars **may be toggled visible or hidden** per user:
  - 📺 Hide avatars to focus
  - 👀 Restore to reconnect
- Nudge logic allows polite repositioning of clustered avatars (“👋 Tap to make room”)

> Politeness in Copelkra can literally move people.  
> Even 100,000 sock avatars standing on the same webpage.

---

## 🧭 Navigation & Avatar Roles

- **Avatars do not replace the interface**
- They do not handle navigation or replace UI functions
- Users return home via a **Home Node button** found globally in the UI
- AI Personas remain inside rooms or buses and never act as navigation hubs

> *Rooms may be rooms. Or wombs. But your exit sign is always marked.*

---

## 🛡️ Avatar Ethics

- No impersonation of real people  
- No financial indicators or clout signals  
- No metadata layering (unless opt-in)  
- No gender or biometric cues unless user enables them

Avatars remain sacredly symbolic.

## 🧠 Notes: Existential Doodles

> ✏️ Use any color to make margin notes.  
> But if you’re using a black felt-tip…  
> That’s not highlighting. That’s just drawing.  
> Unless you meant to draw—in which case, carry on, Picasso.
