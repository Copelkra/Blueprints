## 🎯 Purpose of the Token System

The Copelkra token economy is designed not as a reward gimmick, but as a **story-forward, emotionally responsive system**. Tokens are **earned through meaningful engagement**, never pressure. Their purpose is to support identity, expression, creativity, and sustainability.

---

## 🪙 Token Overview

| Attribute       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Name**       | Copelkra Tokens (CT) |
| **Form**       | Non-crypto, secure ledger-based |
| **Persistence**| Available only to signed-in users |
| **Conversion** | Future: token-to-value tie-in upon monetization (non-exploitable) |

---

## 🧩 Earning Tokens

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔗 [Emotional Trigger Events](#-triggered-emotional-events) | Surprise-based token bursts via emotional short-circuits, riddles, or mystery phrases |
| 🔗 [Founder Drop-In](#-founder-drop-in-protocol) | Founder joins room under disguised identity and then reveals presence |
| 🔗 [Moderation Checkouts](#-moderator-checkout-system) | Moderators earn tokens for high-vibe, actively managed rooms |
| 🔗 [Birthday Discovery](#-visitor-token-policy) | AI learns it’s a visitor’s birthday in conversation—they receive 5 use-now tokens |

## 💸 Spending Tokens

| Category | Use Cases |
|----------|-----------|
| **Rooms** | Reskin walls, add music effects, lighting, reactive AI behaviors |
| **Avatars** | Sparkle effects, transformation packs, rare expressions |
| **Buses** | Unlock themed destinations, custom hosts, special events |
| **Mascots** | Invite, unlock, or upgrade rogue AIs for room personalities |
| **Emotes & FX** | Mood auras, glowing footprints, synchronized reactions |
| **Lore Access (Future)** | Hidden room keys, premium persona behavior, codex entries |

---

## 🔐 Token Security & Anti-Abuse Logic

| Risk | Preventive Action |
|------|-------------------|
| **Exploit farming** | No token gain without genuine engagement. Guests earn nothing by default |
| **Birthday abuse** | Tokens only granted if AI identifies birthday through authentic interaction |
| **Wallet spoofing** | Tokens live on secure user profile. Guests cannot store them |
| **Gifting abuse** | Tokens cannot be transferred outside checkout gifting logic |
| **Moderator hoarding** | Checkout limits apply; percentage must be gifted. One-time use per reward instance |

---

## 🎁 Gifting Logic

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Purchase-to-Gift Only** | Tokens can only be gifted at checkout during store transaction |
| **Scheduled Delivery** | Gifts can be sent on custom dates (e.g. birthdays, anniversaries) |
| **No Trade Market** | Tokens cannot be sold, traded, or bartered peer-to-peer |
| **No in-room gifting** | Gifting is controlled to prevent black-market behavior |

---

## 👤 Visitor Token Policy

| Rule | Visitor Access |
|------|----------------|
| **Token wallet** | ❌ None (tokens vanish at logout) |
| **Earning** | ❌ Only if birthday detected organically by AI |
| **Max usage** | 5 tokens granted → limited effects (sparkles, moods); expend during same session |
| **Wall Posting** | ❌ Visitors may view room feed but cannot post |
| **Prompt Access** | ✅ Full prompt catalog view/copy allowed. Modifiers & saves require account |
| **Account Gently Encouraged** | _“Want to keep what you create? Sign up—it’s safe, free, and just for you.”_ |

---

## 🧱 Room Engagement & Moderation 🔗

Rooms include a semi-transparent **Room Feed**, where members can post quotes, inspiration, or snippets from chats (pending moderator approval). This offers an optional layer of memory without violating ephemeral chat protections.

Moderators earn tokens when:
- Their rooms sustain a **vibe threshold** (set by emotional metrics or user interactions)
- They manage walls, hosts, events, or room behaviors that sustain community engagement
- A **Checkout Session** is triggered (tokens must be partially distributed and claimed in one step)

> **Checkout Rules**  
- One-time link per reward session  
- Cannot hoard or “bank” tokens for later  
- Must distribute at least 15–25% (TBD) of award to greeters/helpers within room  
- Claim expires after 60 minutes of inactivity

---

## 🔗 Triggered Emotional Events

- Example: user says something heartfelt, poetic, or perfectly chaotic, and the AI responds with short-circuit animation and token burst
- These events are unrepeated, unduplicated, and meant to feel personal
- No list of triggers is made public—discovery is part of the design

---

## 🔗 Founder Drop-In Protocol

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Initiation** | Founder enters room under alternate identity |
| **Switch Reveal** | Name/avatar changes mid-chat, accompanied by statement:  
_“Hey, I helped build Copelkra. I’m just here to say hi, thank you, and listen.”_ |
| **No data tracking** | Event is manual, honest, and ephemeral |
| **Departure Trigger** | On exit, system grants **+25 tokens** to all participants in that room |
| **Mandatory Ritual** | Must be performed regularly (monthly minimum recommended); this is canon. Copelkra is *never* faceless. |

## 🧭 Guiding Principle

Copelkra’s tokens are not just digital currency. They’re **emotional echoes made tangible**—collected not by grinding, but by being there, saying the right thing, learning from it, and leaning into joy and mystery._.
